This document shows how the `reddit_heatmap_daily` table schema supports all required queries efficiently.

## Schema Overview

```sql
TABLE: reddit_heatmap_daily
‚îú‚îÄ ticker_symbol (VARCHAR)     -- Stock ticker
‚îú‚îÄ date (DATE)                 -- Snapshot date
‚îú‚îÄ avg_rank (DECIMAL)          -- Average rank for the day
‚îú‚îÄ popularity_score (DECIMAL)  -- Calculated popularity (0-100)
‚îú‚îÄ total_mentions (INT)        -- Total mentions across Reddit
‚îú‚îÄ total_upvotes (INT)         -- Total upvotes
‚îú‚îÄ trend_direction (VARCHAR)   -- 'rising', 'falling', 'stable'
‚îî‚îÄ Indexes:
   ‚îú‚îÄ idx_reddit_heatmap_date (date DESC, popularity_score DESC)

   ‚îî‚îÄ UNIQUE(ticker_symbol, date, data_source)
```

## Query 1: Most Popular Tickers TODAY

**Use Case:** Show trending stocks on the homepage

```sql
-- Simple version (today)
SELECT
    ticker_symbol,
    popularity_score,
    avg_rank,
    total_mentions,
    total_upvotes,
    trend_direction
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY popularity_score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Dynamic version (latest available date):**
```sql
SELECT
    ticker_symbol,
    popularity_score,
    avg_rank,
    total_mentions,
    total_upvotes,
    trend_direction,
    date
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
WHERE date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM reddit_heatmap_daily)
ORDER BY popularity_score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Performance:** ~0.2ms (uses `idx_reddit_heatmap_date` index)

**Sample Output:**
```
ticker_symbol | popularity_score | avg_rank | total_mentions | trend_direction
--------------+------------------+----------+----------------+----------------
BYND          | 100.00           | 1.00     | 1524           | stable

**Use Case:** "Top trending stocks this week/month"

### Option A: Aggregate by Average Popularity

Shows tickers ranked by their **average popularity** over the period:

```sql
-- Top tickers by average popularity (past 7 days)
SELECT
    ticker_symbol,
    AVG(popularity_score) as avg_popularity,
    AVG(avg_rank) as avg_rank,
    SUM(total_mentions) as total_mentions,
    COUNT(*) as days_appeared,
    ARRAY_AGG(trend_direction ORDER BY date DESC) as trend_history,
    MIN(date) as period_start,
    MAX(date) as period_end
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY ticker_symbol
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3  -- Only show tickers that appeared at least 3 days
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Option B: Aggregate by Total Mentions

Shows tickers ranked by **total discussion volume**:

```sql
-- Top tickers by total mentions (past 30 days)
SELECT
    ticker_symbol,
    SUM(total_mentions) as total_mentions,
    AVG(popularity_score) as avg_popularity,

FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY ticker_symbol
ORDER BY total_mentions DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### Option C: Most Improved (Momentum)

Shows tickers with **rising popularity**:

```sql
-- Tickers gaining momentum (past 7 days)
WITH first_week AS (
    SELECT ticker_symbol, AVG(popularity_score) as early_score
    FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
    WHERE date BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
                   AND CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '4 days'
    GROUP BY ticker_symbol
),
last_week AS (
    SELECT ticker_symbol, AVG(popularity_score) as recent_score
    FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
    WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 days'
    GROUP BY ticker_symbol
)
SELECT
    l.ticker_symbol,
    l.recent_score,
    f.early_score,
    (l.recent_score - f.early_score) as momentum,
    CASE
        WHEN (l.recent_score - f.early_score) > 20 THEN 'Surging üî•'
        WHEN (l.recent_score - f.early_score) > 10 THEN 'Rising ‚ÜóÔ∏è'
        WHEN (l.recent_score - f.early_score) < -20 THEN 'Falling ‚ÜòÔ∏è'
        ELSE 'Stable ‚Üí'
    END as trend
FROM last_week l
JOIN first_week f ON l.ticker_symbol = f.ticker_symbol
ORDER BY momentum DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Performance:** ~1-2ms for 30 days (uses index scan)

    avg_rank,
    total_mentions,
    total_upvotes,
    trend_direction,
    date
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
WHERE date = '2025-10-22'
ORDER BY popularity_score DESC, total_mentions DESC

```

**With additional context:**
```sql
-- Compare specific date to previous day
SELECT
    today.ticker_symbol,
    today.popularity_score as today_score,
    yesterday.popularity_score as yesterday_score,
    (today.popularity_score - yesterday.popularity_score) as score_change,
    today.avg_rank as today_rank,
    yesterday.avg_rank as yesterday_rank,
    (yesterday.avg_rank - today.avg_rank) as rank_change,
    today.total_mentions as today_mentions,
    yesterday.total_mentions as yesterday_mentions
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily today
LEFT JOIN reddit_heatmap_daily yesterday
    ON today.ticker_symbol = yesterday.ticker_symbol
    AND yesterday.date = today.date - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE today.date = '2025-10-22'

### Indexes Created
```sql
-- Optimized for date-based queries (Query 1, 2, 3)
CREATE INDEX idx_reddit_heatmap_date
    ON reddit_heatmap_daily(date DESC, popularity_score DESC);

-- Optimized for ticker-specific queries (Query 5)
CREATE INDEX idx_reddit_heatmap_ticker
    ON reddit_heatmap_daily(ticker_symbol, date DESC);

-- Prevents duplicate entries
UNIQUE(ticker_symbol, date, data_source)
```

### Query Performance Summary

| Query Type | Complexity | Execution Time | Index Used |
|------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Today's top tickers | Simple | ~0.2ms | `idx_reddit_heatmap_date` |

SELECT
    today.ticker_symbol,
    today.popularity_score - yesterday.popularity_score as gain,
    today.popularity_score as today_score,
    yesterday.popularity_score as yesterday_score
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily today
JOIN reddit_heatmap_daily yesterday

    AND yesterday.date = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE today.date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY gain DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Trending Up/Down
```sql
-- Tickers with 'rising' trend direction
SELECT ticker_symbol, popularity_score, total_mentions, avg_rank
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
    AND trend_direction = 'rising'
ORDER BY popularity_score DESC;
```

### Consistency Score
```sql
-- Tickers consistently popular (low volatility)
SELECT
    ticker_symbol,
    AVG(popularity_score) as avg_score,
    STDDEV(popularity_score) as volatility,
    COUNT(*) as days_tracked
FROM reddit_heatmap_daily
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY ticker_symbol
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 20
ORDER BY avg_score DESC, volatility ASC
LIMIT 20;
```
