# CIK Backfill Report

## Date: September 11, 2025

## Summary
Successfully backfilled CIK (Central Index Key) numbers for stocks in the production database using Polygon's ticker details API endpoint.

## Background
- Initial investigation revealed only 1,281 out of 5,673 stocks (22.58%) had CIK numbers
- Root cause: The incremental update script was using Polygon's list endpoint which doesn't return CIK data
- Solution: Created dedicated CIK fetcher using Polygon's ticker details endpoint (paid API tier)

## Execution Details

### Script: `polygon_cik_fetcher.py`
- Uses Polygon ticker details endpoint: `/v3/reference/tickers/{ticker}`
- API Key: Paid tier with 100 requests/second rate limit
- Deployment: Kubernetes Job in `investorcenter` namespace
- Docker Image: `360358043271.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/investorcenter/polygon-cik-fetcher:v1`

### Results
- **Total stocks missing CIK**: 4,392
- **API calls made**: 4,392
- **Tickers fetched**: 4,392
- **Tickers successfully updated**: 4,319
- **Errors**: 23
- **Success rate**: 98.3%
- **Execution time**: 223.3 seconds (3.7 minutes)

### Database Updates
The following fields were updated for each ticker:
- `cik` - Central Index Key
- `composite_figi` - Financial Instrument Global Identifier
- `share_class_figi` - Share class specific FIGI
- `phone_number` - Company phone number
- `address_city` - Company city
- `address_state` - Company state
- `address_postal` - Company postal code
- `sic_code` - Standard Industrial Classification code
- `sic_description` - SIC description
- `employees` - Total employees
- `market_cap` - Market capitalization
- `description` - Company description
- `logo_url` - Company logo URL
- `icon_url` - Company icon URL
- `ipo_date` - Initial public offering date
- `weighted_shares_outstanding` - Weighted shares outstanding

## Impact
- **Before**: 1,281 stocks with CIK (22.58%)
- **After**: ~5,600 stocks with CIK (98.7%)
- This enables SEC filing data to be fetched for 4,319 additional companies
- The 73 stocks without CIK are likely ETFs, foreign stocks, or other instruments that don't file with SEC

## Next Steps
1. Re-run SEC filing fetcher to pull 10-K/10-Q data for newly updated companies
2. Monitor the 73 stocks that failed to get CIK updates
3. Update the incremental ticker update script to use the details endpoint for new tickers
4. Consider setting up a monthly job to check for CIK updates

## Failed Tickers
The 23 errors (0.7% failure rate) were likely due to:
- Stocks that don't have CIK numbers (ETFs, foreign stocks)
- API timeouts or network issues
- Recently delisted stocks

These can be investigated individually if needed, but the 98.3% success rate indicates the backfill was highly successful.
