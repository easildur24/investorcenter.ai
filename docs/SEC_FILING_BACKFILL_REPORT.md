## Data Quality Notes

1. **Companies without filings (378)** likely include:
   - Recently IPO'd companies with no reports yet
   - Foreign companies with different filing requirements
   - Companies that may have incorrect or outdated CIK numbers
   - Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) without operations

2. **Filing concentration**: Most filings are from 2023-2025, indicating:
   - SEC API primarily returns recent filings by default
   - Historical data may require additional API calls with specific parameters

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Implement filing content parser to extract text and financial data
   - Set up incremental updates to capture new filings daily
   - Create API endpoints for frontend access
   - Add scheduled jobs for automatic updates
