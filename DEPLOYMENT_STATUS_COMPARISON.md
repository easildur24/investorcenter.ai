## 🟡 PARTIAL / KNOWN ISSUES

### Email Delivery ⚠️

**Status:** Configured but blocked by quota

**Issue:**
- SendGrid free tier quota exceeded
- Verification emails NOT being sent
- Password reset emails NOT being sent

**What Works:**
- SMTP connection successful
- Email code attempts to send
- Error logged: `451 Authentication failed: Maximum credits exceeded`

**Solutions Available:**
1. Upgrade SendGrid plan ($19.95/month)
2. Switch to AWS SES ($0.10 per 1k emails)
3. Manual verification for testing

**Workaround for Testing:**
```bash
# Manually verify user email
kubectl exec -n investorcenter postgres-simple-794f5cd8b7-qg96s -- \
  psql -U investorcenter -d investorcenter_db -c \
  "UPDATE users SET email_verified = TRUE WHERE email = 'user@example.com';"
```

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Well

1. **Systematic Approach**: Following the deployment guide ensured nothing was missed
2. **Database Connection Fix**: Quickly identified and fixed postgres-service vs postgres-simple-service issue
3. **Frontend Deployment**: Successfully deployed Next.js to EKS instead of Vercel
4. **Logging Added**: Email logging helped identify SendGrid quota issue immediately
5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive docs for future reference

### Challenges Faced

1. **Database Service Naming**: Backend was configured for wrong PostgreSQL service
   - **Solution**: Updated DB_HOST to postgres-simple-service

2. **SendGrid Quota**: Free tier ran out of credits
   - **Solution**: Documented alternatives (AWS SES recommended)

3. **Form Styling**: Labels not visible on login page
   - **Solution**: Added explicit text colors (text-gray-700)

4. **AWS Credentials**: SSO session expired during deployment
   - **Workaround**: Need manual refresh via `aws sso login`

### Best Practices Established

1. **Always verify database service names** before deployment
2. **Add comprehensive logging** before deploying to production
3. **Test email delivery** in development before production
4. **Keep deployment documentation** updated with actual steps
5. **Use Docker for frontend** on EKS for consistency
