## Testing Email Functionality

### Test 1: Create a New User (Sends Verification Email)

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.investorcenter.ai/api/v1/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your-email@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword123",
    "full_name": "Test User"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
1. API returns success with access_token and user data
2. Verification email sent to `your-email@example.com`
3. Email subject: "Verify your InvestorCenter.ai account"
4. Email contains verification link

**Check Email:**
- Look in inbox of the email you provided
- If not in inbox, check spam/junk folder
- Email should arrive within 1-2 minutes

### Test 2: Request Password Reset

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.investorcenter.ai/api/v1/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "your-email@example.com"}'
```

**Expected:**
1. API returns success message
2. Password reset email sent
3. Email subject: "Reset your InvestorCenter.ai password"
4. Email contains password reset link

### Test 3: Check Backend Logs for Email Sending

```bash
# View recent logs for email activity
kubectl logs -n investorcenter -l app=investorcenter-backend --tail=50 | grep -i "email"
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ "Sending verification email to..."
- ✅ "Email sent successfully"
- ❌ "Failed to send email..." (if there are errors)

## SendGrid Dashboard

Monitor email activity in your SendGrid dashboard:

1. **Login to SendGrid:** https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. **View Activity:** Go to Activity → Email Activity
3. **Check Stats:** See delivery rates, opens, clicks, bounces

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- **Delivered:** Should be high (95%+)
- **Bounced:** Should be low (<5%)
- **Spam Reports:** Should be minimal
- **Opens:** Track user engagement

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Emails Not Arriving

**Check 1: Verify Backend Can Send**
```bash
# Test from inside a backend pod
kubectl exec -n investorcenter -it $(kubectl get pods -n investorcenter -l app=investorcenter-backend -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- sh

# Inside pod, test SMTP connection
nc -zv smtp.sendgrid.net 587
# Should output: succeeded!
```

**Check 2: Verify SendGrid API Key**
```bash
# Decode the stored password to verify it's correct
kubectl get secret app-secrets -n investorcenter -o jsonpath='{.data.smtp-password}' | base64 -d
# Should output your SendGrid API key starting with "SG."
```

**Check 3: Check SendGrid Activity**
- Go to SendGrid Dashboard → Activity
- Filter by recipient email
- Check delivery status

### Problem: Emails Going to Spam

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Sender Domain** - Add domain verification in SendGrid
2. **Configure SPF/DKIM** - Improves deliverability
3. **Warm Up IP** - SendGrid does this automatically for new accounts
4. **Test with Different Email Providers** - Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo

### Problem: "Authentication Failed" in Logs

**Solution:**
- Verify SendGrid API key is correct and not expired
- Check that username is literally "apikey"
- Regenerate API key in SendGrid if needed
- Update secret and restart backend

---

## SendGrid Account Limits

**Free Tier:**
- 100 emails/day
- Good for development and testing

**Essentials Plan ($19.95/month):**
- 50,000 emails/month
- Better for production

**Monitor Usage:**
- SendGrid Dashboard → Settings → Account Details
- Check remaining email quota

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Test signup with a real email address
2. ✅ Verify email arrives (check spam)
3. ✅ Click verification link and confirm it works
4. ✅ Test password reset flow

### Short Term

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important:**
- SendGrid API key is sensitive - never commit to Git
- Stored securely in Kubernetes secrets
- Only accessible to backend pods
- Rotate API key every 90 days for security

**To Rotate Key:**
1. Generate new API key in SendGrid
2. Update Kubernetes secret:
   ```bash
   kubectl patch secret app-secrets -n investorcenter --type=json -p='[
     {"op": "replace", "path": "/data/smtp-password", "value": "'$(echo -n 'NEW_API_KEY' | base64)'"}
   ]'
   ```
3. Restart backend pods
4. Delete old API key in SendGrid
